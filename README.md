# CMS-PFS-Compiliation
Compilation of historical CMS locality and MAC numbers with all the associated ZIP codes and PFS configuration files.

This project does the following:

(1) Create a master file for historic CMS Localities - by Year
(2) Create a master look-up for a ZIP Code to CMS Locality - by Year
(3) Create a master file for PFS coding configurations (both GPCI and National rates) to ZIP Code and Locality - by Year. 

This project utilizes Juypter Notebooks to clean and query data with SQL Magic commands. Python is used for data validations and all visualizations.

See below for context:
"The current Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) locality structure was implemented in 2017 in accordance with the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (PAMA 2014). Section 220(b) of that legislation added section 1848(e)(6) of the Act, which requires that, for services furnished on or after January 1, 2017, the locality definitions for California be based on the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) delineations as defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)."
